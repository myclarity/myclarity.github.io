    </p>
    <p>
      We provide an online coaching and advice platform that provides useful
      courses and community interaction to help you with every facet of your
      dating and relationship journey. These Terms of Use govern your use of
      SmartDate, a website and mobile application owned by SmartDate, Inc.
      (“SmartDate,” “Company,” “We,” “Our”), which also includes all related
      widgets, tools, data, software, and other services provided by us (the
      “Services”). We may come out with new features from time to time in the
      future, which we will communicate to you through our website and mobile
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document, together with our Privacy Policy and any other terms
      specifically referred to therein, constitute a legally binding agreement

      bound by all the terms and conditions herein. Your acceptance of these
      Terms of Use creates a legally binding contract between you and the
      Company. If you do not agree with any aspect of these Terms of Use, then
      do not click or press “Accept,” in which case you may not use the
